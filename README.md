# Aromatase-Drug-Discovery

I have an intrest of using python and machine learning to maf=ke a differenc ein the world.
I never used python to explore bioinformatics
I used this project as a way to break into the new field.

Using the Chembl database, I used public data on Aromatase, the protein linked to brest cancer, to make models and determine the druglikeliness of this protein.

Sorry if I use the wrong terminology, I haven't taken any college biology courses.

I followed Chanin Nantasenamat's (AKA Dataprofessor) Computation Drug Discovery youtube tutorial.
I found it extremely helpful. Thank You!
